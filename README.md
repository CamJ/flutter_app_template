# Flutter App Model

A structured template to use when creating a Flutter mobile app instead of `flutter create X`.  This removes a lot of fluff provided during `flutter create` and adds structure to the starting repo. 

# TODOs
* Add way to keep up to date with latest templates from `flutter create X`. 
    * Manually
    * Bash script
* Add explanation of the choices made in the structure
